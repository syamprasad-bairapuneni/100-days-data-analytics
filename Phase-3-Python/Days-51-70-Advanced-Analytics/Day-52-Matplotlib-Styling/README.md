\# Day 52 - Advanced Matplotlib Styling



\## 🎯 What I Learned

Professional chart styling and customization - transforming basic visualizations into publication-quality graphics.



\## 🎨 Visualizations Created



1\. \*\*Color Schemes Comparison\*\* (`01\_color\_schemes.png`)

&nbsp;  - Default vs Professional vs Corporate vs Gradient palettes

&nbsp;  - Demonstrates impact of color choice



2\. \*\*Professional Bar Chart\*\* (`02\_professional\_bar\_chart.png`)

&nbsp;  - Year-over-year quarterly comparison

&nbsp;  - Value labels, custom legend, professional styling



3\. \*\*Annotated Line Chart\*\* (`03\_annotated\_line\_chart.png`)

&nbsp;  - Monthly sales with peak/low highlights

&nbsp;  - Annotations with arrows and callouts

&nbsp;  - Average line and shaded area



4\. \*\*Multi-Metric Dashboard\*\* (`04\_professional\_dashboard.png`)

&nbsp;  - 4-panel executive dashboard

&nbsp;  - Bar, line, pie, and scatter plots combined

&nbsp;  - Regional performance analysis



5\. \*\*Before/After Comparison\*\* (`05\_before\_after.png`)

&nbsp;  - Shows impact of professional styling

&nbsp;  - Side-by-side comparison



\## 🔑 Advanced Techniques Applied

\### Layout \& Composition

\- Multi-panel dashboards (GridSpec)

\- Subplots with shared styling

\- Responsive sizing

\- Professional spacing



\### Professional Polish

\- Custom legends (shadows, frames)

\- Grid styling (opacity, dash patterns)

\- Axis formatting (currency, percentages)

\- Border and spine customization

\- Shaded regions and fills



\## 📊 Before vs After



\*\*Basic Chart:\*\*

\- Plain colors

\- No labels

\- Default styling

\- Functional but bland



\*\*Professional Chart:\*\*

\- Curated color palette
